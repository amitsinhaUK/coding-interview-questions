# Interview question: There are n network nodes labelled 1 to N. 
#                     Given a times array, containing edges represented by arrays [u, v, w] where u is the source node, 
#                     v is the target node and w is the time taken to travel from the source node to the target node.
#                     Send a signal from node k, return how long it takes for all nodes to receive the signal. 
#                     Return -1 if itâ€™s impossible.
# Solution Type: Initial solution, Time O(E x log(n) + N x log(n)), Space O(1)
