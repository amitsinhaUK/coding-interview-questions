# Interview question: A company has n employees with unique IDs from 0 to n-1. The head of the company has the ID headID. 
#                     You will receive a managers array where managers[i] is the ID of the manager for employee i. Each employee has one direct manager. 
#                     The company head has no manager (managers[headID] = -1). Itâ€™s guaranteed the subordination relationships will have a tree structure.
# 
#                     The head of the company wants to inform all employees of news. He will inform his direct subordinates who will inform their direct subordinates 
#                     and so on until everyone knows the news. 
# 
#                     You will receive an informTime array where informTime[i] is the time it takes for employee I to inform all their direct subordinates. 
#                     Return the total number of minutes it takes to inform all employees of the news.
